#### Original Plans ####

Final Project Proposal: GraphingGridiron
Project Head: Gavin Schnowske

## Application Overview
The webpage will be designed around the visualization of my collected data, wherein I will include a variety of charts as to best portray all of the different dimensions to my statistics. I also intend to add interactivity with the graphs, such as possibly displaying something when you hover your cursor over a graph, or the clicking of a button to change some part of the application. There will also be additional information which may appear displayed alongside the graphs, whether that is to provide better clarification, or to give my own personal thoughts relevant to the data at hand.

## Technology Overview
Languages: HTML, CSS, Python 3.12.0
Libraries: Matplotlib, Pandas(?)
Platforms: Labtop & Desktop
Hosting: Github
## Feature List
Implementation of various different forms of data visualization (Bar Graphs, Pie Charts, Scatter Graphs, etc...).
Providing the background as to how and where I had gathered my data, as well as summarizing some important details needed in order to comprehend the data, such as what fantasy football is.
Some form of user interactivity with the data presented.
An aesthetically pleasing website that is designed around the chartered data.
The telling of a story through my method of data presentation, recapping all of the events of interest and statistical oddities which occurred throughout my fantasy football league week by week.
## Future Feature List
Animations for my data
The creation of custom graphics for the interface
The ability for the user to visualize their own collected data from their fantasy league through my application
## Basic Technical Features
Backend usage of terminal to execute and test python code
Programming with CSS to create an aesthetically pleasing webpage
HTML to format the webpage
Hosted through a Github repository made through the help of GitHub Pages
## Advanced Technical Features
The use of python libraries such as Matplotlib and Pandas
The Plotting and graphing of data using python

## What I Delivered On
Overall, I would say that I stayed relatively faithful to my original plans as I look back at my finished product.
Starting off with the proposed Feature list, I successfully met my goal of adding various different forms of data visualization, such as but not limited to: Bar Graphs, Line Graphs, Scatter Plots, and Pie Charts.
I also gave background information as to the source of my data, as well as summarized what exactly fantasy football is for those who may be unaware of the game.
I was similarly able to add user interactivity to my graphs through switching from my original proposed python library I intended to use, being Matplotlib, to instead using Plotly, as I liked its features more, also seeing it as easier to translate into an HTML webpage in comparison to Matplotlib.
Using Plotly made the implementation of features such as seeing someone's name when you hover over a marker in a graph, or making buttons that can hide a certain person's data from the graph relatively streamlined and easy for me.
I also did frequently add additive commentaries to my graphs, whether that be giving some guidance on how you can interact with the graph as I did for the first graph, or simply allowing myself to point out some of the peculiarities I noticed in the development of this application.
For the design of the website, I'd say I was effective at making a aesthetically pleasing yet simple webpage that was designed around data visualization at its central focus. I nearly used all of proposed technical features for my project, with the sole exception being using Plotly over Matplotlib, as I explained earlier.
I did use python like stated in my original plans, albeit I used an older version as to be able to use the Conda package manager, which would allow me to work with Plotly.
I also went beyond my proposed python libraries that I would use, as I added numpy for the creation of my stat tables.
For my proposed telling of a story through my method of data visualization is one part to my final project that I failed to fulfill upon. As my project furthered, I realized I wanted to instead invest more of my time in working with statistics, rather than trying to build an overarching narrative throughout the presentation of my data, preferring to instead focus my writing juices towards my commentaries under graphs.
As a final note: I did change the name of my project from GraphingGridiron to The Fantasy Football Report. I did this mainly becaused I liked the more newspaper-like sound of The Fantasy Football Report, as well as it being a much more simple and to the point name than GraphingGridiron ever was.
Features I Would've Added if I Had More Time
I think my future feature list still holds true as the features I would've added if given more time to work on this project. I did try to add animations to my program but I just couldn't get it to work the way I wanted, so animations would probably be the first thing I would try to tackle if I were given more time to develop this project. As for something besides my original future features list, I probably would've expanded my data from my week 1 to week 10 sample to week 1 to week 14, as when I started this project we had only reached the tenth week of fantasy football, as to now where we are now about to start the first games of week 14.
